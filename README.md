# Create printable HTML flashcards

Your teacher gave you learning material in form of a CSV file, but you prefer to learn with physical flashcards? This package can create a printable HTML file for you!

Currently, this package only works with a very specific format. Check out `test.py` to see an example.  I might make this package more generic, if interest arises.
